# First Portfolio

## Description

I needed a way to show my work to prospective clients, so I created a portfolio to feature the various projects I've been working on.

### Features
* Includes my name, photo, and a little bit about me.
* The navigation bar at the top scrolls to the corresponding section.
* My first project is displayed larger to place emphasis on it.
* The first two projects link to my work, but the last two are just placeholders.
* Portfolio is made to fit on screens of various sizes through the use of flex and media queries.

## Credits
